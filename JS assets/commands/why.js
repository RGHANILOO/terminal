      <p>It was a chilly evening of November 2018 when I first stumbled into the Founders and Coders office, drawn by a leaflet I had spotted in Islington library earlier that day. Little did I know that this chance encounter would set me on a transformative journey.</p>
      <p>Today, I am applying to Founders and Coders because it is a vibrant, inclusive, warm, and welcoming community. From my first interaction with Founders and Coders, I was struck by the spirit of collaboration and camaraderie. My technical learning has accelerated since joining Founders and Coders' meetups because it’s an opportunity to connect with others who are equally motivated to progress as Software Developers. I have learned to collaborate with others, whether it’s tackling codewars challenges, reviewing code or receiving feedback for issues i have faced. Receiving mentoring from Founders and Coders faculty has also helped me to become a better communicator which I have applied in online forums where I try to ask more questions or challenge an approach to an issue in order to guide someone towards a solution.</p>
      <p>I am committed to fostering a diverse and inviting space, where anyone can learn to share knowledge and learn, and I believe that I can make a positive contribution to the Founders and Coders network of future learners</p>
