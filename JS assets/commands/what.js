    <p>I found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/">freeCodeCamp</a>â€™s new Data Structures and Algorithms course a useful tool as it now focuses on teaching the concepts as a project building exercises.</p>
    <p>I relied extensively on <a href="learnjavascript.online">Learn JavaScript</a> a course recommended by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">MDN</a>, this helped me with better familiarising myself with modern JS and ES6 and beyond tooling.</p>
    <p>I also utilised video tutorials such as <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JS30</a> by Wesbos, a series of short videos where I took notes on the approaches and went on to building the applications based on my understanding concepts.</p>
    <p>In addition to the areas mentioned above.I have also dedicated time to delve deeper into the <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/">FullStackOpen</a> course. My aim is to enhance my understanding and establish a solid foundation in tools like React, Node, Express, as well as quality assurance and testing concepts. This ongoing learning project is a personal mission undertaken during my free time.</p>
