<p>As a first-generation migrant, I bring a unique perspective shaped by my diverse background. While navigating challenges, I fostered strong empathy, resilience, and creative problem-solving skills. These were instrumental in my success within the advertising and film industry, where I collaborated with diverse teams to develop impactful campaigns. Now, I seek to contribute these skills to real-world social challenges through software development.</p>
<p>Driven by my current open-source contributions to FreeCodeCamp curriculum and Founders and Codersâ€™ supportive community, I am actively honing my skills in JavaScript , Python and other Full Stack technologies to transition into a software developer role. Eager to tackle social challenges through code, I envision collaborating on projects like FCC to empower others and make a lasting difference. For instance, within the Founders and Coders community, I actively participate in discord, organised group study sessions and provided support during meetups demonstrating my commitment to collaborative learning and knowledge sharing.</p>
