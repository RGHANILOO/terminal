# Portfolio 

Nothing fancy to see here its just my [porfolio website!](https://rghaniloo.github.io/terminal/)

### What is this all about then? 

This iteration of the site is part of an application i am making for the upcoming cohort with nice folks at FAC aka Founders & Coders all of it made with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

also doesn't everyone now have a website, even this little dude has [his own](https://puginarug.com/)

- This is my tiny crib on interweb
- This website will be continuously updated as a part of me learning and experimenting  with new tech stack, like Svelte, 11ty, React, or any other frameworks and languages that might interest me.
- I will be updating it with all the new cool things i make to show off.

### Did i hear you say that's cool

Well, thank you, The idea was inspired by N. Carrigans's [site](https://nhcarrigan.com/), however i wanted to go for something that resembled more like my terminal on my computer, i do spend a lot of time there afterall, moving, making, pulling, pushing, debugging, breaking and fixing

This is just a start and the MVP i envisioned for my application maybe a buggy at times but i am proud of it and had alot of fun making it.


#### Funnies aside
### Ongoing Development:

Next steps for ongoing development of this site will be building some or all of the following features:

- Mobile responsive and fully accesible
- Series of mini games that can be played inside of the site
- Tab to complete a prompt/command
- Implementation of Emailjs in contact form.

### Future development 

- Building a functionality for the following commands/prompts
    - Lorem [ a lorem ipsum generator]
    - Theme [ theme switching from light to dark and reverse]
    - Timer [ starts a countdown timer ]
- Some hidden easter eggs
- To contribute to codewars repo to provide maintanance to its public API as i want implement the api in my website
