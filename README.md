# Portfolio 
    Nothing fancy to see here its just my [porfolio website!](link.om)

### What is this all about then? 
This iteration of the site is part of an application i am making for the upcoming cohort with nice folks at FAC aka Founders & Coders

also doesn't everyone now have a website, even this little dude has [his own](https://puginarug.com/)

- This is my tiny crib on interweb
- This website will be continiusly updated as a part of me learning new tech stack, like Svelte, 11ty, React, or other framworks and languages that i might be interested in.
- I will be updating it with all the new cool things i make to show off.




### Did i hear you say that's cool
    Thanks, the idea was inspired by [this](https://nhcarrigan.com/) however i wanted to go for something more that looked like my terminal on my Mac, i do spend a lot of time there afterall.




idea of a simple text based as inout for the site for all 3 sections od who, what and why
the idea is to build a terminal like inpout for navinagationg through to other parts of site and viwing the projects and descrtiptin


things to implement in js:

    if an input doesnt exists in command list return a command ${said-input} not found. try "help"

    available commands: 
        home 
        why?/purpose and why am i applying 
        what?/the product: list of projects/ 
        Who? about me 
        contact how to reach me     
        cv / option ot donwalod it 
        - hidden comments:
